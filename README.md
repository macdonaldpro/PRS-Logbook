This is my first ever README file, containing a documentation of the Blog I'm working on.

Bullet Points Summary
- 

I've been working on the PRS Logbook for two months now, earlier prototypes became the foundation of the current version. The website is set to launch tomorrow on September 29, 2025 with my inaugural post, My journey in programming. There I'll post storytelling, tips and tricks, my projects, and everything that I love about programming, software engineering, designing, etc. The blog has a very minimalist design as I want to make it exist first, over the coming years I will enhance the design to not make it too simple but at the same time make it intuitive to navigate and creative. Unfortunately, it's not connected to my Github repository due to limitations my 2017 MacBook Pro has--but hopefully I'll be able to in the long run.
